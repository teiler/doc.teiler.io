# How to contribute

This is the API specification. Since we need to coordinate API spec changes and actual [API implementation](https://github.com/teiler/api.teiler.io) changes, do as follows:

1. Change the specification and open a pull request, describing what this solves
2. We will discuss this new specification and eventually approve it
3. Implement it in the API implementation
4. Open a pull request there, when it's approved, copy the link to that in the API specification PR
5. We will push the new specification to master
